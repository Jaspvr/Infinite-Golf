# Infinite Golf
An animation of a golf ball (almost) going in a hole made with js and html canvas.

# What it does
After a brief "loading screen" of 5 bounces the golf ball bounces around the window until in goes "in the hole".
However, every 14 bounces off the wall, the direction of the ball reverses which causes the ball to never go in the hole.
To see the ball go in the hole, the two if statements with (count == 14) as the condition can be commented out.

# To run:
Download the two files into the same directory and open the html file.
